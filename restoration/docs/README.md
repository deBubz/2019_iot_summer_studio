# About Me

Hey I'm Bao and I'm a first year IT Student at UTS, majoring in Enterprise System development.
My current goal so far is to be a part of the software development world, and hopefully one day leading my own project.

## Tech Interests

In the off time I have I like to mess around with the linux environment, "learning" vim, and maybe one day forfeit the need of using a mouse.
Beside from that, I've been looking into how IoT devices functions recently.
I have some smart lights to play around with at home, but I would like to build my own app and have more control than what the official apps provided.

## Skills
