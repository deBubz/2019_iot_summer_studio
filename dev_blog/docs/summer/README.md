# Summer IoT Studio

I'm attending this studio with the purpose of discovering and learning the process of building a product, and expose myself to other technologies. 
I have been tasked to carry out this Studio in multiple Sprints over four weeks with the purpose of coming up with a solution to a problem.
This small blog is to document my progress and achievements throughout the studio so I could better understand and improve by learning abilities.

## What Am I Solving

I often take night walks when Im stressed out from everyday life.
The problem is the street lights around my walking route are often broken.
Making me feel unsafe.
You would think the local council is responsible for keeping the lights maintained, but they are often non-functional for several weeks at a time.

A quick online search reveals the majority of NSW's light system still relies on online forms to report faulty lights, 
a very inefficient reporting systems as it still relies on manual labor to process the reports, 
and it does not guarantees that those faulty Lights are reported as they break.
Some of these forms can be seen [here](https://www.unitedenergy.com.au/contact-us/reportstreetlight/) and [here](https://www.ausgrid.com.au/In-your-community/Report-a-problem/Streetlights).

### Solution

My solution is a system of trackers record light data and report whenever there is an issue with the lights.
This system would also be used to generate data that could reveal more deeper problem in the power grid.

And here is the architecture of the system I`ll be building throughout the studio.
Each devices will gather and transfer data through a MQTT broker server.
Then the data will be stored in the database to be interfaced with on a WebApp

## Learning Contract

### Objectives

To ensure Here is a learning contract that I am Following for the whole duration of the Studio. Here are the topics I want to achieve in the studio.

- `Basic electronics`: Before the studio, I do not have any prior electronics knowledge, and want to learn the basic structure of a circuit, how they function see how information is passed around. This would be extremely useful in the process of building the backend logic of this Studio's project. Additionally, I could use what I leaned from the studio to build more projects for myself.
- `Communication`: I've always been working on my own, while software or any kind of project production always involves multi-diciplinary group of people working together. Getting to develop my communication skills would greatly improve my learning experience at UTS and future profession in general.
- `Stronger Programming Skills`: I want to be exposed to more tools(languages, frameworks) which I could use to solve large and more complex problems I might encounter in my future career path. Especially Learning how data moves, stored on the cloud server and working with the CLI. I could use this knowledge to better improve,build and deploy my projects online. It could be a big head start for the Networking and Programming classes I`ll be taking in the future.

### Strategies and resources

- There are an unlimited source of information online and that can be overwhelming. Danon had been very incredible in pointing me in the right way. I just gotta ask for help.
- I can work on my electronics and communications skills by being more proactive in the studio. A large portion of my peers are Electrical Engineering majors, thus talking to them is always a good way to improve.
